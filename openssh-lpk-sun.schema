# This file was adapted from /usr/share/doc/openssh-ldap-*/openssh-lpk-sun.schema
# I changed the sshPublicKey attribute from "MUST" to "MAY" to make it optional
# I replaced tabs with spaces
# and removed blank lines within the dn entry
# all lines must be chained together (no blank lines) until the very end
# and the last line in the file must be blank
